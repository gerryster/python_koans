* https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8 is used for auto code formatting (at least according to VS Code's plugin recommendations).
  * https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo seems to be a similar Ruby idea.

* Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

* Functions like list and range are built in global functions [documented here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
