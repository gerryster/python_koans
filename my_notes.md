## Notes

* https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8 is used for auto code formatting (at least according to VS Code's plugin recommendations).

* Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

* Functions like list and range are built in global functions [documented here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
